## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Adam_headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Adam Gelb, and I am a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I love problem solving, building, designing, and all things engineering. Outside of academics, I am the vice president and assistant coach of Cornell Rowing Club, where I help manage the team of over 50 members for year-round practices three days a week. I am also the recorder and house manager at Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, where I am responsible for all communication inside and outside of the fraternity with Cornell and Nationals. 

I am a passionate learner and love to take on tough challenges to work through a way to a solution. I am a dedicated, hard-working individual who excels in a team.
