As part of a class project, I was put in a team of four people where we were tasked with coming up with a working prototype to solve a problem in a dorm room. Other than some general requirements, this is all that we were given. Through seven different steps, we had to go from an idea to a working prototype, in about 2 months time. These steps included: 
    - Idea generation and brainstorming
    - "Scrappy" prototype of three ideas
    - Revision and iteration
    - Picking a final design
    - Initial prototype
    - Revision and iteration 
    - Final Prototype


Below are photos documenting our process from step one to step seven:
